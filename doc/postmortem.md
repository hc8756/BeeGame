# Project Postmortem

What went wrong?

Time. Time was one of our largest issues. We didn't have too many good oppritunities to meet up and discuss the project, and our time manegment overall was a bit lacking. This was especially prevalent during milestone 4 as it is the end of the semester and we all have a heap of projects to be working on at once.

Communication also started to dwindle towards the end. During the first few milestones, we had great standards for our communication and were fairly active with it, but in later milestones, it was lacking. We ended up frantically messaging eachother before class to get milestone documentation complete.

What went right?

Because we were a lot more committed to our weekly meetings and had more time at the beginning, we did manage to get our mvp done fairly quickly without too much trouble. I guess one takeaway from that is that a strong start is important, and getting a lot of work done while you have the time helps a lot down the road. Also, we managed to add a few of our stretch goals, and we were always fair in the distribution of tasks.

What did you learn from this process?

when everyone is committed and working together, things get done 10 times faster. Also, it helps to meet with your group a few extra times even when you feel like everything is under control just to catch up with eachother, help with problems other people may be having, and bounce ideas off of eachother.

What will you do differently next time? 

We did have a task manager but honestly it was kind of abandonned after a while. Every milestone we had more and more things to add and fix, and we didn't always update the manager accordngly. Therefore we were sometimes confused as to what was done and what was not, as well as who was doing what. We just sort of haphazardly added tasks and split them fairly evenly before doing our own thing. In the end, we ran out of time and couldn't add our own art or sound. Next time we would plan ahead more thouroughly so that we know what will be done by when in order to finish all the tasks in time.
